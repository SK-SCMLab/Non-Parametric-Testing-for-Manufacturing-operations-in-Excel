## ⚽️ Non-parametric tests
Non-parametric tests do not make any assumptions about a distribution model where the data could fit. They compare groups of medians using the relative ranks of data within the groups. These graphs may skew right or skew left. Non-parametric tests are used when:

- Data **does not follow a normal distribution**
- Sample sizes are **small or uneven**
- Data is **ordinal** or has **outliers**
- We want to **compare medians or ranks** instead of means

These tests are powerful tools for robust, distribution-free inference, in real-world manufacturing scenarios where data violates parametric assumptions

## 🏀 Mann-Whitney U Test
Mann Whitney test is a non-parametric test used to compare the center between two unpaired groups. The obtained U has to be equal to or less than the critical value.

## 🏈 Kruskal-Wallis Test 
The Kruskal-Wallis test is used for testing the source of origin of the samples. It is the only way to analyze the variance by ranks. The medians of two or more samples are compared to fixed the source of origin. It does not assume the normal distribution of the residuals

## ⚾️ Mood's Median test
The Mood's Median test is a non-parametric test that is used to test the equality of medians from two or more different population. The test works if:

      - The output (Y) variable is continuous, discrete-ordinal or discrete-count
      - The input (X) variable is discrete with two or more attributes

## 🎾 Freidman Test
The Freidman test is a form of non-parametric test that does not make any assumptions on the origin of the sample
