## ‚öΩÔ∏è Non-parametric tests
Non-parametric tests do not make any assumptions about a distribution model where the data could fit. They compare groups of medians using the relative ranks of data within the groups. These graphs may skew right or skew left. Non-parametric tests are used when:

- Data **does not follow a normal distribution**
- Sample sizes are **small or uneven**
- Data is **ordinal** or has **outliers**
- We want to **compare medians or ranks** instead of means

These tests are powerful tools for robust, distribution-free inference, in real-world manufacturing scenarios where data violates parametric assumptions

## üèÄ Mann-Whitney U Test
Mann Whitney test is a non-parametric test used to compare the center between two unpaired groups. The obtained U has to be equal to or less than the critical value. The calculated value is not equal to or less than.
